# Project Overview: Inventory Management System

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop an efficient, user-friendly inventory management system for managing store or warehouse products. This application allows users to add, edit, and delete products, track inventory levels, and generate reports like low-stock alerts and sales summaries. The design incorporates a modern flat UI for an intuitive experience.

## Key Activities

### **Design and Development of GUI**
- Designed an interactive and modern graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.
- Applied a flat orange and white color scheme to provide a clean and minimalistic design.
- Included easy-to-use navigation buttons for managing inventory and accessing reports.

### **Functionalities Implementation**
- Implemented CRUD operations for products:  
  - **Add:** Add new products to the inventory database with attributes like name, category, quantity, and price.  
  - **Edit:** Modify product details when required.  
  - **Delete:** Remove products no longer in the inventory.  
- Added features for tracking inventory levels and generating low-stock alerts to ensure proactive management.
- Developed a reporting module to summarize sales and inventory performance.

### **User Authentication**
- Implemented a secure login system to restrict unauthorized access and ensure data protection.

### **Data Validation**
- Included input validation for product details (e.g., preventing negative quantities or invalid price entries).
- Handled invalid user inputs with error messages.

### **Responsive Layout**
- Used a grid layout to structure the interface, ensuring seamless resizing across different window sizes.

### **Database Integration**
- Designed and integrated an SQLite database for persistent product storage.
- Populated the database with sample data, enabling smooth demonstrations and testing.

### **Reporting**
- Enabled users to generate:  
  - **Low-Stock Alerts:** Identify products below a certain quantity.  
  - **Sales Summaries:** Aggregate sales data to analyze trends.
